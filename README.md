# 🧠 Agentic AI Projects

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Projects** repository — a collection of hands-on projects built using various **agentic AI frameworks** like **CrewAI**, **OpenAI Agents SDK**, **LangGraph**, and **AutoGen**.

The goal is to explore, build, and share real-world applications of multi-agent LLM systems — from planning and decision-making to tool usage and automation.
